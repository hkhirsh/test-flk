## Explore proportional time data from Thomas D
Using data provided by Thomas on Jan 8
Email: "Florida Keys Line"

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(magick)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(ggrepel)
library(rstudioapi)
library(stringr)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(mapview)
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
register_google(key = "AIzaSyB3mq0nJtcNWvQUNuqH_t-MLxEUmwDDmGk") #new api OCT2023

```

## Load data from Thomas

```{r}
propTime = st_read('/Users/heidi.k.hirsh/Desktop/refloridakeysline/time_north_shp/time_north.shp')
head(propTime)
View(propTime)
```

## Restructure data from Thomas so that the columns for each time fraction (ex: north_1d) are including in "North_Fraction" and "South_Fraction" columns
I think I need to pivot_longer to accomplish this

```{r}
propTime.L = pivot_longer(data=propTime,cols=-c(simu,sample_id,geometry),names_to="side.ndays",values_to="fraction")
names(propTime.L)
head(propTime.L)
```
## Now I need to separate out the number of days into new "ndays" column
After taking out the number of days I can separate north and south fractions into separate columns. 

```{r}
#string split side.ndays to isolate number of days
#then save that number to a new column called ndays
#also save north or south to new column

split = str_split(string = propTime.L$side.ndays, "_")
propTime.L$side.ndays
split[[1:dim(propTime.L)[1]]][1]
dim(propTime.L)[1]

```
